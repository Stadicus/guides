# FAQ

### Can I get rich by routing Lightning payments?
Nobody knows. Probably not. You will get minimal fees. I don't care. Enjoy the ride! 

### Can I attach the Ext4 formatted hard disk to my Windows computer?
The Ext4 file system is not compatible with standard Windows, but with additional software like  [Linux File Systems](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/linuxfs-windows/#faq) by Paragon Software (they offer a 10 days free trial) it is possible.
