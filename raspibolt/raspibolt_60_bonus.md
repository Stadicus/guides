### Beginner’s Guide to ️⚡Lightning️⚡ on a Raspberry Pi

# Bonus (optional)

In this section, you can find various optional topics that make your RaspiBolt running even smoother. I split this up in various subsections, as the individual tasks can be quite long.

## [**System overview**](raspibolt_61_system-overview.md)

*Difficulty: easy*

Your RaspiBolt will greet you with a quick system summary on login:

## [**Pimp the command line**](raspibolt_62_commandline.md)

*Difficulty: easy*

Make your command line prompt shine with a golden ฿ and use more colors overall:

## [**Electrum Personal Server**](raspibolt_64_electrum.md)

*Difficulty: intermediate*

The RaspiBolt is the perfect trustless Bitcoin backend for your regular on-chain transactions. Together with the Electrum wallet, it works even with your Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet.

## **Email alerts** (upcoming)

*Difficulty: intermediate*

Let your RaspiBolt inform you by email in case the system or a service is restarted. As you need to manually unlock the LND wallet, this can be very helpful.

## System recovery

Difficulty: easy

In case your SD card gets corrupted or you brick your node, it's handy to have a quick recovery image at hand. It's not a full backup solution, but allows a system recovery.
