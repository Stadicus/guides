# Bonus (optional)

In this section, you can find various optional topics that make your RaspiBolt running even smoother. I split this up in various subsections, as the individual tasks can be quite long.

## [**System overview**](raspibolt_61_system-overview.md)

*Difficulty: easy*

Your RaspiBolt will greet you with a quick system summary on login:

## [**Electrum Personal Server**](raspibolt_64_electrum.md)

*Difficulty: intermediate*

The RaspiBolt is the perfect trustless Bitcoin backend for your regular on-chain transactions. Together with the Electrum wallet, it works even with your Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet.

## [**Use `lncli` on a different computer**](raspibolt_66_remote_lncli.md)

*Difficulty: easy*

Control your Lightning node from a different computer within you network, eg. from a Windows machine.

## [**System recovery**](raspibolt_65_system-recovery.md)

Difficulty: easy

In case your SD card gets corrupted or you brick your node, it's handy to have a quick recovery image at hand. It's not a full backup solution, but allows a system recovery.

## [Additional scripts: show balance & channels](raspibolt_67_additional-scripts.md)

Difficulty: easy

These additional bash scripts display a balance overview (on-chain & in channels, active & inactive) as well as a nicely formatted channels overview.
